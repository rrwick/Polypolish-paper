This repo contains supplementary data for our paper describing Polypolish: [Wick RR, Holt KE. Polypolish: short-read polishing of long-read bacterial genome assemblies. PLOS Computational Biology. 2022. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009802.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009802)

If you're interested in Polypolish itself (i.e. not the paper), then head over to [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish).

This repo has the following subdirectories:
* [`figures`](figures): contains all figures (both main text and supplementary) for the paper.
* [`polisher_wrappers`](polisher_wrappers): contains Bash scripts we wrote to run the polishers in an easy and consistent manner.
* [`R`](R): contains two R Markdown scripts (one for the simulated-read tests and one for the real-read tests) used to do analyses and generate plots.
* [`scripts`](scripts): contains custom Python scripts we wrote to conduct the analyses in the paper.
* [`tables`](figures): contains all supplementary tables for the paper.

The datasets used in this paper (reads, assemblies and references) are too large for a GitHub repo, so you can download them from here: [bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Polypolish_paper_dataset/16727680](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Polypolish_paper_dataset/16727680)
